## Introduction

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how apps connect with AI models. As more crypto projects adopt MCP, we're moving closer to autonomous on-chain systems. This repo collects reliable MCP implementations in the crypto space to help developers build better crypto agents.

## Server Implementations

### Production-Ready

- [Base-MCP](https://github.com/base/base-mcp) - A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides onchain tools for AI applications like Claude Desktop and Cursor, allowing them to interact with the Base Network and Coinbase API.

### Experimental

## Documentation

- [MCP Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) - Detailed documentation of the MCP.

## Examples

- [Base MCP Demo](examples/base-mcp/) - Example implementation of crypto trading agent with Base MCP and open-soucred Web3 Agent Model trained by FLock community
